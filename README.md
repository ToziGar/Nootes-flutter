# Nootes-flutter

This repository is the Nootes Flutter application. A feature branch `feature/expanded-mvp` is being scaffolded to implement the Expanded MVP (offline-first sync, server-pagination, robust sharing, cached images, advanced search, editor autosave and UX polish).

See `docs/roadmap.md` for the planned milestones and acceptance criteria.
