# Changelog — Work completed by assistant

Date: 2025-10-24

Summary
-------
This change set contains a focused set of fixes and improvements to make the sync queue and secure storage testable, to repair a corrupted `SyncService` implementation, to add unit tests, and to clear a number of analyzer warnings across UI files.

What I changed
--------------
- Implemented and cleaned up `lib/services/sync_service.dart`:
  - Restored a single, correct `SyncService` class implementing queue processing, exponential backoff, dead-letter handling, persistence, and public APIs: `enqueue`, `start`, `stop`, `processOnce`, `retryDeadLetter`, and `removeDeadLetter`.
  - Fixed a persistence bug: when moving an item to dead-letter the queue state is also persisted.

- Refactored `lib/services/queue_storage.dart`:
  - Introduced `SecureKeyValueStorage` abstraction to allow injection of platform adapters.
  - Added a `FlutterSecureKeyValueStorage` adapter and an in-memory fake `InMemorySecureKV` for tests.
  - Defensive JSON parsing and write error handling to avoid crashes on malformed stored data.

- Tests added:
  - `test/queue_storage_test.dart` — tests for `InMemoryQueueStorage` behaviour.
  - `test/secure_queue_storage_test.dart` — tests for `SecureQueueStorage` using `InMemorySecureKV`.
  - `test/sync_service_test.dart` — tests for `SyncService` retry/backoff and dead-letter behaviour using a fake `FirestoreService`.

- Analyzer/style fixes across UI files:
  - Replaced unused double-underscore parameters with descriptive names (e.g., `(context, index)`) in many files to remove `unnecessary_underscores` hints.
  - Files touched include (not exhaustive):
    - `lib/widgets/sync_status_widget.dart`
    - `lib/widgets/visual_improvements.dart`
    - `lib/notes/note_editor_page.dart`
    - `lib/notes/trash_page.dart`
    - `lib/pages/shared_folder_viewer_page.dart`
    - `lib/pages/shared_notes_page.dart`
    - `lib/profile/profiles_list_page.dart`
    - `lib/profile/handles_list_page.dart`

Verification
------------
- `flutter analyze` — No issues found.
- `flutter test` — All tests passed locally.

Notes & rationale
-----------------
- Making secure storage injectable enables unit tests to run on desktop and CI without platform-specific plugins.
- Persisting both queue and dead-letter queues ensures consistent recovery after restarts.
- The stylistic changes are minimal and aim to reduce analyzer noise.

Next recommended actions
------------------------
1. Open a PR with these changes and include this changelog as the PR description.
2. Add more unit tests for `SyncService` to cover scheduling behavior, timing/backoff correctness, and `retryDeadLetter` APIs.
3. Review dependency updates (`flutter pub outdated` reported several newer versions). Consider upgrading non-breaking packages or doing a staged upgrade with CI tests.
4. Optionally add integration tests that exercise the end-to-end sync flow against a Firestore emulator.

How to reproduce locally
------------------------
Run these commands at the repository root:

```pwsh
flutter analyze
flutter test
```

If you want me to open a branch and create a PR for these changes, say so and I will create the branch, commit the changes, and prepare a PR draft (I will not push without your confirmation). If you want me to also run `flutter pub outdated` and propose version bumps, I can do that next.
